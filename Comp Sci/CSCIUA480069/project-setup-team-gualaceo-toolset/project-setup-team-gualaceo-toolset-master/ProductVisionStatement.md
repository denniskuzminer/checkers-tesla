# Product Vision Statement

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Having an interactive interface
- Being able to get user playlists from Spotify
- Have users join, create, and leave groups/playlists
- Implementation of a group structure (group owner with ability to control settings about the group)
- Using Spotify recommendation API to generate recommendations for groups

## Process After Establishing Vision

#### After finishing the MVP, we would like to

- Implement a music player in the app
- Clone playlists for individual users to edit on their own

### Themes

- User Interface/ Front-end

  - As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate through the app.

- Group Structure

  - As a user, I want to be able to join/create and interact with a group.
  - As a user, I'd like to be able to access to any groups I've already joined or created.
  - As a group owner, I want to be able to modify the group's playlist.

- Song Recommendation

  - As a user, I want to be able to add my music to (or remove it) from the group so it will be considered.
  - As a user, I want to get song recommendations from songs entered previously, considering all members of the group's entries.
  - As a user, I want to access the group playlist.

- Implementing Spotify API

  - As a user, I want to be able to connect to the app with Spotify and access data on Spotify.
