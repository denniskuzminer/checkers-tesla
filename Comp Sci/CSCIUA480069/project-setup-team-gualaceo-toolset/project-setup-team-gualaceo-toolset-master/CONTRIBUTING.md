# Guide to Contributing

### Project's Values and Team Norms

- Consistent communication - Members should feel free to disclose any issues, concerns, or recommendations they have regarding the project.

- Effort and Commitment - Members should show up regularly to meetings and contribute consistently.

- Honesty - Members should be honest in communicating, especially in the Scrum meetings, whether it is about what they have done, what they will be doing, or what issues and blockers they are facing.

### Definition of "**Done**"

- This definition of the product's "done" will change, but our final definition of "done" will be our [Minimum Viable Product](./ProductVisionStatement.md).

- The definition of a main-branch-worthy "done" would be a fully implementable meaningful functionality that doesn't raise any bugs in the code and is runnable without any issues (or fixing bugs that do rise from the new function in the same pull request).

### Git Workflow

- Mostly Centralized; upon making new changes, each member will create a new branch, edit their branch, and send a pull request to see if that branch should be merged to the main as the "current version."

### Some Rules

- _Anyone_ may make changes to the code, but we ask that you inform the team and specify what the newly added code does when submitting a pull request.

- When writing code, developers should leave clear comments about what their code is doing.

### Conflict Resolution

- Please communicate any conflicts with the Scrum Master, Product Owner, or the team as a whole.

- Project-related conflicts could be addressed to the Product Owner.

- Conflicts relating to disagreements between members could be addressed by the Scrum Master.

- If the Product Owner or Scrum Master was involved in the conflict, those involved in the conflict could choose someone else to mediate it.

- If the designated person was unable to resolve the conflict or if a team member misses consecutive Scrum meetings, the issues will be raised to the management.

### Project Setup

- Regarding our technologies, we will be using VS Code along with the extension Live Share to collaborate on this project.

- This information will be provided in the [README.md](./README.md)
